Session Context: HUB75 LED Matrix Implementation and Debugging

## Analysis
This conversation is a continuation of a previous session about fixing LED matrix control issues and creating animations for a HUB75 64x64 display. The conversation began with context about prior work on fixing logging issues, directory naming problems, and performance optimization attempts.

## Key Technical Work
- Researched and identified hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix library for hardware acceleration
- Created multiple implementation files for HUB75 control
- Encountered persistent file transfer and deployment issues
- Fixed color calculation bug causing OverflowError (negative RGB values)
- Created test_color_math.py which found 112 errors in original HSV calculations

## Files Created/Modified
1. install_rgb_matrix.sh - Installation script for hardware library
2. hub75_hardware_driver.py - Hardware-accelerated driver wrapper
3. conductor_hub75_optimized.py - Optimized conductor using hardware acceleration
4. smooth_gradient_hardware.py - Test animation
5. deploy_hub75_optimized.sh - Deployment script
6. quick_hub75_setup.py - Simplified setup (contains color bug)
7. test_color_math.py - Color calculation test script
8. integrated_hub75_conductor.py - Complete conductor with web GUI

## Major Issues Encountered
- Files not actually being created in expected locations
- HTTP 404 errors when trying to download files
- Directory path confusion
- OverflowError: can't convert negative value to uint8_t
- User frustration with repeated failures

## User Feedback
- "THIS IS GETTING OLD. REVIEW WHAT THE FUCK YOURE DOING"
- "I WANT YOU TO TEST THESE BEFORE I TRANSFER THEM"
- Preferred transfer method: python3 -m http.server 8000

## Current Status
- Fixed color math issue in HSV to RGB conversion
- Have working test script (test_color_math.py)
- Need to create corrected version of quick_hub75_setup.py
- User demanding all code be tested before deployment

## Todo List Status
- Fix log_startup passing logger as version parameter (completed)
- Add get_config_dict method to LEDMatrix class (completed)
- Fix permissions issue for logs directory (completed)
- Fix stats file permissions issue (completed)
- Add 'running' attribute to Config object for web API (pending)

## Next Steps
Create and test a corrected version of quick_hub75_setup.py with fixed color calculations before suggesting transfer to Pi.
