- [ ] Review hub75_hardware_driver.py implementation (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Study integrated_hub75_conductor.py architecture (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Design unified HUB75 driver architecture (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Plan GUI enhancement structure (priority: high, status: pending)

## Phase 2: Driver Implementation
- [ ] Create consolidated HUB75 driver class (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Implement double buffering with SwapOnVSync() (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Add hardware PWM support detection (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Integrate with existing matrix_driver.py (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Add HUB75 configuration management (priority: medium, status: pending)

## Phase 3: GUI Enhancement
- [ ] Add matrix type selection dropdown (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Create HUB75 configuration panel (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Implement real-time parameter updates (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring widgets (priority: low, status: pending)
- [ ] Update API endpoints for HUB75 control (priority: high, status: pending)

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement recommended performance tweaks (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Add CPU isolation configuration (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Configure fixed frame timing (priority: medium, status: pending)
- [ ] Optimize animation loops (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements (priority: medium, status: pending)

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for HUB75 driver (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Create integration tests (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Perform hardware verification (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Write setup documentation (priority: high, status: pending)
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with HUB75 commands (priority: medium, status: pending)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create action plan
- [x] Research HUB75 best practices and requirements

## Notes
- Existing codebase has substantial HUB75 support already
- Focus on consolidation and enhancement rather than starting from scratch
- Maintain backward compatibility with WS2811 matrices
